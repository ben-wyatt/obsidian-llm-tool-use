Going to establishments that operate with the singular purpose of serving only gluten-free cuisine aren’t usually on their must-hit list. Eating at places with delicious food, which happens to be gluten-free, on the other hand: now we’re talking. The following handful of restaurants offer a wide range of options for celiacs and anyone who favors a gluten-free diet. Given the topic, some of the names below are likely unexpected, but we can confidently say that the food is better than good, and the dishes mentioned are gluten-free. In this latest map update, find ceviches and tartare at Peruvian mini-chain Mission Ceviche, a fabulous gluten-free rigatoni from Carbone, Thai dishes at Wondee Siam, and much more.\\nCeviche and tartare made on the spot, an octopus with cilantro oil, and a long list of seafood, risottos, and other cooked dishes — all sans gluten— come alive at these Peruvian restaurants (multiple locations). The food is bright, colorful, and fresh. Add in the expansive menu of tequilas and cocktails, plus the beautiful design, and the stage is set for a great night out.\\nThai food can be tricky to navigate for a gluten-free eater, but Wondee Siam in Hell’s Kitchen serves a variety of seriously good and authentic dishes that fit the bill. They’re marked on the menu and include the spicy tom yum soup, a handful of curries, salmon with mango sauce, and steamed whole red snapper topped with lemon sauce, garlic, chiles, and cilantro.\\nThe Astoria location of this sleek Greek taverna is owned by cousins Nick Tsoulos and Nick Pashalis, who are also behind Avra Estiatorio. Gluten-eaters are spoiled for choice here: the half-dozen dips, such as the tzatziki, accompanied by sliced cucumbers instead of pita, are the kick-off to a feast. Picks like grilled calamari or octopus, Chilean sea bass skewers with a roasted pepper and garlic aioli, any of the salads including the classic Greek, grilled whole fish, meats, and sides such as grilled vegetables are all fair game.\\nAlways hopping, Nizza is dedicated to Ligurian comfort food and has many gluten-free options, presented to diners in a gluten-friendly menu. The choices include house-made bread, accompanied by full-bodied olive oil, socca, or crispy chickpea pancake topped with sage, onions, and pecorino, vegetable antipasti like the roasted honey nut squash, and more than a half-dozen corn-based pasta dishes, including the anything but basic spaghetti pomodoro.\\nThis cheery joint is a mainstay weekend brunch place: the solid burgers draw us in. They’re available on gluten-free buns, which are surprisingly palatable, unlike other cardboard-like versions out there. Order the spiced turkey burgers with balsamic roasted peppers, arugula, and tomato jam. Vary it by ordering one of the hearty salads such as the greens and grains with rice, sweet peas, avocado, shaved Brussels sprouts, and arugula. Or build-your-own-entree, where you can pick your preferred protein and two sides.\\nReasonably priced and tasty temaki — cone-shaped hand rolls stuffed with rice and all manners of proteins or vegetables — are the highlight at the hip Japanese eatery Nami Nori. The lineup includes the vegan sweet potato tempura, the familiar spicy tuna, and the creative Triple, comprised of toro, uni, and caviar. The best part of a visit is that the entire menu is gluten-free. It’s a big selection and includes non-temaki picks such as the addictive tempura misto with calamari, shrimp, onions, and zucchini, a clam soup, and shishito peppers with a smoked honey miso.\\nMichael Ayoub, the owner of this popular Greenpoint pizzeria and Italian joint, makes his own gluten-free flour that he crafts into a thin, light pizza crust. The result is a base for some of the tastiest pies in New York, such as the Pugliese, sausage with broccoli rabe, mozzarella, pecorino, and Fresno chiles. The soft, almost buttery focaccia is another winner, as are all the salads and dishes from the wood-burning oven, like the Brussels sprouts with a maple balsamic glaze.\\nYes, the restaurant is famous for spicy rigatoni vodka and other decadent pasta iterations. Yet, it is a gluten-free haven. Unbeknownst to many, the Italian spot — and all other Major Food Group restaurants — makes a gluten-free rigatoni in-house. It’s so good that you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference if you compare it to pasta made with wheat. So you can go to Carbone and get that spicy vodka sauce fix. You can also tuck into other no-gluten dishes, such as the fried zucchini, which uses rice flour, the branzino, black bass with Thai herbs, and charcoal-cooked steaks.\\nMuch of the menu at the in-demand chic Indian restaurant Bungalow is gluten-free. That includes the pomegranate-chile-flavored Anarkali chicken, tandoori avocado, lamb chops and seekh kebab, and black lentil daal. Bungalow even offers a gluten-free roti. The chickpea-based take on a staple doesn’t have the same pliable texture as the original, but it is still craveable, especially when you request that it get a brushing of ghee.\\nThe essential places to eat and drink Out East\\nBabysips and the Ripple Room join the list this month\\nCorn dogs, chopped cheese, samsa, and more\\nFrom classic sandwiches with egg and processed cheese to dressed-up BECs with bulgogi and raclette\\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

If you don\\'t eat gluten, this guide has options for everything from bagels and pasta to Chinese food and arepas. Some of the places on here aren’t completely gluten-free—so be sure to check with your server about specific dishes and cross-contamination concerns—but they’re all spots where you can get an excellent meal that won’t just be a bowl of rice and an apple.\\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it’s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal.\\nSonal Shah\\n95 Guernsey St, New York, New York 11222\\nJapanese\\nGreenpoint\\nUzuki serves pure buckwheat soba noodles and buckwheat-based snacks out of a warehouse-like space in Greenpoint’s Japanese microneighborhood. Prices range wildly from bowl to bowl: the menu’s splashier soba bowls have toppings like a boatload of sashimi, but the $32 uni shiosoba in rich duck broth is just as satisfying. They also have gluten-free soba beer, and you can hang out with a date in the lamp-lit room, admiring the ceramics that the chef made themselves. If you\\'re looking for more Japanese gluten-free dishes in the immediate area, Acre and Dashi Okume both have good options.\\nKate Previte\\n12 E 22nd St, New York, New York 10010\\nKorean\\nFlatiron\\nNot everything at Coqodaq is gluten-free, but the most important item is. This fancy Korean fried chicken restaurant in Flatiron fries their chicken in rice flour, so their three flavors of chicken—original recipe, gochujang, and soy garlic—are completely GF. (So are the squeeze bottles of sauces they come with). Some sides are not, including the mac and cheese and cold noodle dish, but the kitchen can make the entire meal sans gluten with some substitutions. If you’re looking for a flashy birthday spot that feels like a club, get a group together so you can snag a booth, and splurge on a few caviar-topped chicken nuggets. \\n474 Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10024\\nVegan\\nUpper West Side\\nBeing the gluten-free one in your dinner group can sometimes feel like you’re asking to eat off a kids menu that doesn’t come with crayons or any other type of fun. At Thyme & Tonic, you can take an entire GF crew to a very adult restaurant just for them. The menu is gluten-free and mostly-vegan, with everything from kung pao cauliflower rice bowls to a Sunday brunch provided with assistance from the GF bakery next-door, Modern Bread and Bagel. They also have an extensive bar with great cocktails, and there\\'s a lively scene both inside and out on their flower-powered outdoor dining area. \\nPOWERED BY\\nEmily Schindler\\n472 Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10024\\nBagels\\nUpper West Side\\nIt can be tough to find gluten-free baked goods that aren\\'t so dry they spin into a pile of dust like Michael Jackson in the Remember the Time video. We can assure you the bagels, breads, and pastries at Modern Bread & Bagel will not do this. This Upper West Side bakery has everything from GF naan and challah to funfetti cupcakes and chocolate babka, and they also serve some good sandwiches. \\nAlex Staniloff\\n309 E 5th St, New York, NY 10003\\nItalian\\nEast Village\\nRice is already gluten-free, but you’ll know Risotteria Melotti is made specifically for gluten-free eaters when you see the rest of the menu. In addition to an extensive selection of perfectly al dente risottos, the 100% GF offerings include antipasti like crispy calamari fried in rice flour and bruschetta on rice bread, as well as rice-based desserts like tiramisu made with rice sponge cake. You’ll eat everything in a kitschy space that looks like a rustic Italian villa gone awry, with a ladder, a wooden crate, and antique lighting hanging from the ceiling. \\nPOWERED BY\\nSebastian Lucrecio\\n31 Carmine St, New York, New York 10014\\nJapanese\\nWest Village\\nNo disrespect to gluten-free baked goods, but the sandwich bread at Postcard does not taste gluten-free. It tastes like fluffy and slightly sweet angel food cake, which is appropriate for a candy-colored place that also sells mochi doughnuts and strawberry boba tea. This zero-gluten West Village Japanese bakery from the folks behind Nami Nori doesn’t have much seating—just a single pastel banquette—so plan on stopping by for a quick takeout snack. The egg salad sando is simple, messy, and inhalable.\\nTeddy Wolff\\n284 3rd Ave, New York, NY 11215\\nMexican\\nGowanus\\nMexican restaurants are generally one of your safest bets if you’re GF, and Claro is one of our favorite Mexican spots in NYC. The menu is Oaxacan and entirely gluten-free. They make their corn tortillas in-house, and even when they come topped with smoky chile sauce, beef tongue, and bacon, you can still taste how good the masa is. Other highlights are the aguachile, garnachas, and fantastic mole. The menu changes seasonally and isn’t particularly long, but what they do, they do extremely well.\\nPOWERED BY\\nDane Isaac\\n75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011\\nAmerican\\nChelsea\\nFriedman’s was opened with celiacs in mind, with the goal of creating an entirely GF menu. At any of their six NYC locations, you can get brunch favorites like pancakes, waffles, french toast, and fried chicken, as well as sandwiches and dinner entrees that could take on their wheaty counterparts any day of the week. Leave some room for a side of mac and cheese. Most things with a ton of cheese sauce mixed in are a go, but that doesn\\'t make us any less impressed by the rice-based version here. \\nNoah Devereaux\\n372 Lafayette St., New York, NY 10012\\nMexican\\nNOHO\\nAtla is an all-day Mexican spot in Nolita where you can eat some flax seed chilaquiles and potato flautas, both of which contain zero gluten. The tacos are also gluten-free, as are a bunch of other things like the maitake mushrooms and beef brisket. Atla is from the same people behind\\xa0Cosme, but it’s much more casual, and it’s ideal for when you need to meet up for a daytime meal with a client or a friend who’s slightly cooler than you.\\n785 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY  10065\\nChinese\\nUpper East Side\\nEveryone deserves a good, reliable General Tso’s option, fried up in whatever breading they prefer. At Lilli and Loo on the Upper East Side, you\\'ll find glossy chicken, dumplings, lo mein, and a lot more on their extensive gluten-free menu. We like the dense, flour-alternative crust on dishes like their General Tso’s shrimp and tangerine beef, and the lo mein gets the job done if you’re looking for something more substantial. (There\\'s also a good sushi selection.)\\nJessica Hansen\\n206 Sullivan St, New York, NY 10012\\nItalian\\nGreenwich Village\\nIf you don’t want to worry about coming in contact with any gluten whatsoever, Senza Gluten should be (or might already be) in your regular rotation. This is a completely gluten-free Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village, and the obvious upside here is that you can order anything without worrying whether or not you can actually eat it. A few things to know: This place only takes cash and Amex, the entrees are in the $30 range, and you’ll hear romantic music that could plausibly be played in a commercial for jewelry or cell phone family plans.\\nPOWERED BY\\nNoah Devereaux\\n460 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10024\\nVegetarian\\nUpper West Side\\nPeacefood is perfect for when you need a low-key place where you can just walk in and not worry about explaining your dietary preferences to three different waiters. At this all-day vegan spot, GF items are clearly labeled on the menu, with options like pumpkin quiche, chickpea fries (an essential order), and a variety of baked goods. Peacefood is casual, the food comes out quickly, there\\'s a location near Union Square, in addition to this one on the Upper West Side. \\nEmily Schindler\\n235 Mulberry St., New York, NY 10012\\nPizza\\nNolita\\nRubirosa is a crowd-pleaser. The atmosphere is dark and lively, the thin-crust pizza is some of the best in the city, and you don’t need to spend a ridiculous amount of money to have a good time. Plus, there’s an entire gluten-free menu that includes everything from pizza and pasta to chicken parm and mozzarella sticks. Yes, the waits can be extremely long (maybe even a few hours), but either make a reservation online or put your name in for a table and find a bar where you can hang out nearby (like Spring Lounge or Mother’s Ruin).\\n7 Grain Army\\n88 Roebling, New York, NY 11211\\nBakery/Cafe\\nWilliamsburg\\n7 Grain Army should be considered a holy place for people looking for gluten-free baked goods. All of the muffins, coffee cakes, and sandwiches at this Williamsburg bakery are made with grains like fonio and quinoa. Their coffee cake has the consistency of a Twinkie, and the blueberry muffin filled with sweet cranberry jam is a regular guest star in our food dreams. The small shop on Roebling Street closes by 3pm, and we highly recommend coming early to try everything while it’s fresh out of the oven.\\nNoah Devereaux\\n317 Union Ave, New York, NY 11211\\nVegetarian\\nWilliamsburg\\nModern Love isn’t your typical comfort food restaurant. This Williamsburg spot is entirely vegan, so the \"fried chicken\" is oyster mushroom and the “chorizo” on the nachos is made from sun-dried tomatoes and walnuts. About half the menu is gluten-free, but even if you’re with friends who don’t share your dietary restrictions, this place has great dishes that everyone will enjoy, such as the mac and cheese made with cashew cheddar.\\nPOWERED BY\\nArepa Lady\\n77-17 37 Ave, New York, NY 11372\\nColombian\\nJackson Heights\\nIt probably goes without saying, but at Arepa Lady, you should be eating arepas. Most of the options here are gluten-free, and they\\'re marked as such on the menu. The grilled and stuffed arepas rellena are solid, but be sure to get at least one arepa de queso. Those arepas are thick, fluffy, and filled with melted mozzarella and your choice of meat. \\nNoah Devereaux\\n186 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011\\nPasta\\nChelsea\\nPastai is Chelsea’s resident charming Italian place. The food tastes good, they make their own pasta, and you could easily bring a date or a small group here. They can also make any of their dishes with gluten-free pasta, also made in house. There’s a bunch of bar seating and an old-school-looking dining room with black and white portraits of people you can pretend are part of your family.\\n\\nFormer Staff Writer, NYC\\nNeha is originally from California.

Eating at places with delicious food, which happens to be gluten-free, on the other hand: now we’re talking.

In this latest map update, find ceviches and tartare at Peruvian mini-chain Mission Ceviche, a fabulous gluten-free rigatoni from Carbone, Thai dishes at Wondee Siam, and much more.\\nCeviche and tartare made on the spot, an octopus with cilantro oil, and a long list of seafood, risottos, and other cooked dishes — all sans gluten— come alive at these Peruvian restaurants (multiple locations). The food is bright, colorful, and fresh. Add in the expansive menu of tequilas and cocktails, plus the beautiful design, and the stage is set for a great night out.\\nThai food can be tricky to navigate for a gluten-free eater, but Wondee Siam in Hell’s Kitchen serves a variety of seriously good and authentic dishes that fit the bill. They’re marked on the menu and include the spicy tom yum soup, a handful of curries, salmon with mango sauce, and steamed whole red snapper topped with lemon sauce, garlic, chiles, and cilantro.\\nThe Astoria location of this sleek Greek taverna is owned by cousins Nick Tsoulos and Nick Pashalis, who are also behind Avra Estiatorio. Gluten-eaters are spoiled for choice here: the half-dozen dips, such as the tzatziki, accompanied by sliced cucumbers instead of pita, are the kick-off to a feast. Picks like grilled calamari or octopus, Chilean sea bass skewers with a roasted pepper and garlic aioli, any of the salads including the classic Greek, grilled whole fish, meats, and sides such as grilled vegetables are all fair game.\\nAlways hopping, Nizza is dedicated to Ligurian comfort food and has many gluten-free options, presented to diners in a gluten-friendly menu. The choices include house-made bread, accompanied by full-bodied olive oil, socca, or crispy chickpea pancake topped with sage, onions, and pecorino, vegetable antipasti like the roasted honey nut squash, and more than a half-dozen corn-based pasta dishes, including the anything but basic spaghetti pomodoro.\\nThis cheery joint is a mainstay weekend brunch place: the solid burgers draw us in. They’re available on gluten-free buns, which are surprisingly palatable, unlike other cardboard-like versions out there. Order the spiced turkey burgers with balsamic roasted peppers, arugula, and tomato jam. Vary it by ordering one of the hearty salads such as the greens and grains with rice, sweet peas, avocado, shaved Brussels sprouts, and arugula. Or build-your-own-entree, where you can pick your preferred protein and two sides.\\nReasonably priced and tasty temaki — cone-shaped hand rolls stuffed with rice and all manners of proteins or vegetables — are the highlight at the hip Japanese eatery Nami Nori. The lineup includes the vegan sweet potato tempura, the familiar spicy tuna, and the creative Triple, comprised of toro, uni, and caviar. The best part of a visit is that the entire menu is gluten-free. It’s a big selection and includes non-temaki picks such as the addictive tempura misto with calamari, shrimp, onions, and zucchini, a clam soup, and shishito peppers with a smoked honey miso.\\nMichael Ayoub, the owner of this popular Greenpoint pizzeria and Italian joint, makes his own gluten-free flour that he crafts into a thin, light pizza crust. The result is a base for some of the tastiest pies in New York, such as the Pugliese, sausage with broccoli rabe, mozzarella, pecorino, and Fresno chiles. The soft, almost buttery focaccia is another winner, as are all the salads and dishes from the wood-burning oven, like the Brussels sprouts with a maple balsamic glaze.\\nYes, the restaurant is famous for spicy rigatoni vodka and other decadent pasta iterations. Yet, it is a gluten-free haven. Unbeknownst to many, the Italian spot — and all other Major Food Group restaurants — makes a gluten-free rigatoni in-house. It’s so good that you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference if you compare it to pasta made with wheat. So you can go to Carbone and get that spicy vodka sauce fix. You can also tuck into other no-gluten dishes, such as the fried zucchini, which uses rice flour, the branzino, black bass with Thai herbs, and charcoal-cooked steaks.\\nMuch of the menu at the in-demand chic Indian restaurant Bungalow is gluten-free. That includes the pomegranate-chile-flavored Anarkali chicken, tandoori avocado, lamb chops and seekh kebab, and black lentil daal. Bungalow even offers a gluten-free roti. The chickpea-based take on a staple doesn’t have the same pliable texture as the original, but it is still craveable, especially when you request that it get a brushing of ghee.\\nThe essential places to eat and drink Out East\\nBabysips and the Ripple Room join the list this month\\nCorn dogs, chopped cheese, samsa, and more\\nFrom classic sandwiches with egg and processed cheese to dressed-up BECs with bulgogi and raclette\\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

If you don\\'t eat gluten, this guide has options for everything from bagels and pasta to Chinese food and arepas. Some of the places on here aren’t completely gluten-free—so be sure to check with your server about specific dishes and cross-contamination concerns—but they’re all spots where you can get an excellent meal that won’t just be a bowl of rice and an apple.\\nUnrated: This is a restaurant we want to re-visit before rating, or it’s a coffee shop, bar, or dessert shop. We only rate spots where you can eat a full meal.\\nSonal Shah\\n95 Guernsey St, New York, New York 11222\\nJapanese\\nGreenpoint\\nUzuki serves pure buckwheat soba noodles and buckwheat-based snacks out of a warehouse-like space in Greenpoint’s Japanese microneighborhood. Prices range wildly from bowl to bowl: the menu’s splashier soba bowls have toppings like a boatload of sashimi, but the $32 uni shiosoba in rich duck broth is just as satisfying. They also have gluten-free soba beer, and you can hang out with a date in the lamp-lit room, admiring the ceramics that the chef made themselves. If you\\'re looking for more Japanese gluten-free dishes in the immediate area, Acre and Dashi Okume both have good options.\\nKate Previte\\n12 E 22nd St, New York, New York 10010\\nKorean\\nFlatiron\\nNot everything at Coqodaq is gluten-free, but the most important item is. This fancy Korean fried chicken restaurant in Flatiron fries their chicken in rice flour, so their three flavors of chicken—original recipe, gochujang, and soy garlic—are completely GF. (So are the squeeze bottles of sauces they come with). Some sides are not, including the mac and cheese and cold noodle dish, but the kitchen can make the entire meal sans gluten with some substitutions. If you’re looking for a flashy birthday spot that feels like a club, get a group together so you can snag a booth, and splurge on a few caviar-topped chicken nuggets. \\n474 Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10024\\nVegan\\nUpper West Side\\nBeing the gluten-free one in your dinner group can sometimes feel like you’re asking to eat off a kids menu that doesn’t come with crayons or any other type of fun. At Thyme & Tonic, you can take an entire GF crew to a very adult restaurant just for them. The menu is gluten-free and mostly-vegan, with everything from kung pao cauliflower rice bowls to a Sunday brunch provided with assistance from the GF bakery next-door, Modern Bread and Bagel. They also have an extensive bar with great cocktails, and there\\'s a lively scene both inside and out on their flower-powered outdoor dining area. \\nPOWERED BY\\nEmily Schindler\\n472 Columbus Ave, New York, NY 10024\\nBagels\\nUpper West Side\\nIt can be tough to find gluten-free baked goods that aren\\'t so dry they spin into a pile of dust like Michael Jackson in the Remember the Time video. We can assure you the bagels, breads, and pastries at Modern Bread & Bagel will not do this. This Upper West Side bakery has everything from GF naan and challah to funfetti cupcakes and chocolate babka, and they also serve some good sandwiches. \\nAlex Staniloff\\n309 E 5th St, New York, NY 10003\\nItalian\\nEast Village\\nRice is already gluten-free, but you’ll know Risotteria Melotti is made specifically for gluten-free eaters when you see the rest of the menu. In addition to an extensive selection of perfectly al dente risottos, the 100% GF offerings include antipasti like crispy calamari fried in rice flour and bruschetta on rice bread, as well as rice-based desserts like tiramisu made with rice sponge cake. You’ll eat everything in a kitschy space that looks like a rustic Italian villa gone awry, with a ladder, a wooden crate, and antique lighting hanging from the ceiling. \\nPOWERED BY\\nSebastian Lucrecio\\n31 Carmine St, New York, New York 10014\\nJapanese\\nWest Village\\nNo disrespect to gluten-free baked goods, but the sandwich bread at Postcard does not taste gluten-free. It tastes like fluffy and slightly sweet angel food cake, which is appropriate for a candy-colored place that also sells mochi doughnuts and strawberry boba tea. This zero-gluten West Village Japanese bakery from the folks behind Nami Nori doesn’t have much seating—just a single pastel banquette—so plan on stopping by for a quick takeout snack. The egg salad sando is simple, messy, and inhalable.\\nTeddy Wolff\\n284 3rd Ave, New York, NY 11215\\nMexican\\nGowanus\\nMexican restaurants are generally one of your safest bets if you’re GF, and Claro is one of our favorite Mexican spots in NYC. The menu is Oaxacan and entirely gluten-free. They make their corn tortillas in-house, and even when they come topped with smoky chile sauce, beef tongue, and bacon, you can still taste how good the masa is. Other highlights are the aguachile, garnachas, and fantastic mole. The menu changes seasonally and isn’t particularly long, but what they do, they do extremely well.\\nPOWERED BY\\nDane Isaac\\n75 9th Ave, New York, NY 10011\\nAmerican\\nChelsea\\nFriedman’s was opened with celiacs in mind, with the goal of creating an entirely GF menu. At any of their six NYC locations, you can get brunch favorites like pancakes, waffles, french toast, and fried chicken, as well as sandwiches and dinner entrees that could take on their wheaty counterparts any day of the week. Leave some room for a side of mac and cheese. Most things with a ton of cheese sauce mixed in are a go, but that doesn\\'t make us any less impressed by the rice-based version here. \\nNoah Devereaux\\n372 Lafayette St., New York, NY 10012\\nMexican\\nNOHO\\nAtla is an all-day Mexican spot in Nolita where you can eat some flax seed chilaquiles and potato flautas, both of which contain zero gluten.

Eating at places with delicious food, which happens to be gluten-free, on the other hand: now we’re talking.

      "Ceviche and tartare made on the spot, an octopus with cilantro oil, and a long list of seafood, risottos, and other cooked dishes — all sans gluten— come alive at these Peruvian restaurants (multiple locations). The food is bright, colorful, and fresh. Add in the expansive menu of tequilas and cocktails, plus the beautiful design, and the stage is set for a great night out.\n",
      "Thai food can be tricky to navigate for a gluten-free eater, but Wondee Siam in Hell’s Kitchen serves a variety of seriously good and authentic dishes that fit the bill. They’re marked on the menu and include the spicy tom yum soup, a handful of curries, salmon with mango sauce, and steamed whole red snapper topped with lemon sauce, garlic, chiles, and cilantro.\n",
      "The Astoria location of this sleek Greek taverna is owned by cousins Nick Tsoulos and Nick Pashalis, who are also behind Avra Estiatorio. Gluten-eaters are spoiled for choice here: the half-dozen dips, such as the tzatziki, accompanied by sliced cucumbers instead of pita, are the kick-off to a feast. Picks like grilled calamari or octopus, Chilean sea bass skewers with a roasted pepper and garlic aioli, any of the salads including the classic Greek, grilled whole fish, meats, and sides such as grilled vegetables are all fair game.\n",
      "Always hopping, Nizza is dedicated to Ligurian comfort food and has many gluten-free options, presented to diners in a gluten-friendly menu. The choices include house-made bread, accompanied by full-bodied olive oil, socca, or crispy chickpea pancake topped with sage, onions, and pecorino, vegetable antipasti like the roasted honey nut squash, and more than a half-dozen corn-based pasta dishes, including the anything but basic spaghetti pomodoro.\n",
      "This cheery joint is a mainstay weekend brunch place: the solid burgers draw us in. They’re available on gluten-free buns, which are surprisingly palatable, unlike other cardboard-like versions out there. Order the spiced turkey burgers with balsamic roasted peppers, arugula, and tomato jam. Vary it by ordering one of the hearty salads such as the greens and grains with rice, sweet peas, avocado, shaved Brussels sprouts, and arugula. Or build-your-own-entree, where you can pick your preferred protein and two sides.\n",
      "Reasonably priced and tasty temaki — cone-shaped hand rolls stuffed with rice and all manners of proteins or vegetables — are the highlight at the hip Japanese eatery Nami Nori. The lineup includes the vegan sweet potato tempura, the familiar spicy tuna, and the creative Triple, comprised of toro, uni, and caviar. The best part of a visit is that the entire menu is gluten-free. It’s a big selection and includes non-temaki picks such as the addictive tempura misto with calamari, shrimp, onions, and zucchini, a clam soup, and shishito peppers with a smoked honey miso.\n",
      "Michael Ayoub, the owner of this popular Greenpoint pizzeria and Italian joint, makes his own gluten-free flour that he crafts into a thin, light pizza crust. The result is a base for some of the tastiest pies in New York, such as the Pugliese, sausage with broccoli rabe, mozzarella, pecorino, and Fresno chiles. The soft, almost buttery focaccia is another winner, as are all the salads and dishes from the wood-burning oven, like the Brussels sprouts with a maple balsamic glaze.\n",
      "Yes, the restaurant is famous for spicy rigatoni vodka and other decadent pasta iterations. Yet, it is a gluten-free haven. Unbeknownst to many, the Italian spot — and all other Major Food Group restaurants — makes a gluten-free rigatoni in-house. It’s so good that you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference if you compare it to pasta made with wheat. So you can go to Carbone and get that spicy vodka sauce fix. You can also tuck into other no-gluten dishes, such as the fried zucchini, which uses rice flour, the branzino, black bass with Thai herbs, and charcoal-cooked steaks.\n",
      "Much of the menu at the in-demand chic Indian restaurant Bungalow is gluten-free. That includes the pomegranate-chile-flavored Anarkali chicken, tandoori avocado, lamb chops and seekh kebab, and black lentil daal. Bungalow even offers a gluten-free roti. The chickpea-based take on a staple doesn’t have the same pliable texture as the original, but it is still craveable, especially when you request that it get a brushing of ghee.\n",
