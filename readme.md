I'll be using Qwen 2.5 7b through Ollama to start, since it scores very high on tool calling.

## List of Actionable Items
- write first system prompt: include the details on how obsidian works like [[]] and whatever. See how well it performs
- make a new test vault folder
- write first two tools: get list of .md files in Vault folder, create new file and write something in that file.
