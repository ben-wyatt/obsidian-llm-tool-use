        "question": "What was I working on June 26th?",
        "answer": "On June 26th, you were mainly working on unblocking your evaluation framework for running tests on the nemotron-h-lawsky model. Your immediate focus was getting the NeMo framework image running properly on Kubernetes, which involved setting up secrets, writing and applying the deployment YAML, and scaling the deployment to check if it scheduled on GPU nodes. Once that was working, your next step was to convert the model weights to Hugging Face format and run evaluations.\n\nYou also planned to handle your work expenses before your upcoming break.\n\nIn terms of broader thinking, you had a conversation with Michael Cyran about continual learning and concluded that your focus should be on evaluation—exploring tools, observability, and possibly investing in custom-written tax questions. You were reflecting on your current work at EY and feeling unproductive, especially in comparison to peers like Vashisth. This led you to start looking into Columbia's AI program and think about writing a blog post to share your observations.\n\nOverall, the day was a mix of technical progress on evaluation infrastructure and personal reflection on direction and motivation."

        "question": "Summarize the dwarkesh podcasts about china.",
        "answer": "The two Dwarkesh podcasts on China, featuring Arthur Kroeber and Ken Rogoff, provide a multifaceted view of China's economic development, political structure, and its global implications.\n\nArthur Kroeber emphasizes that China[s economic rise is not inherently problematic—its wealth benefits global welfare—but how it achieved that growth, particularly through authoritarian governance and trade imbalances, creates tensions with the US-led democratic order. China's political system challenges the idea that prosperity requires democracy, which unsettles the West. Kroeber highlights the country's vast trade surplus, rooted in high savings and limited domestic consumption, and its strategy of using industrial policy to leapfrog into advanced sectors like EVs and green energy. He rejects the Cold War analogy for US-China relations, noting their deep economic integration. He also suggests that the US might benefit from accepting more Chinese investment in advanced manufacturing, despite national security concerns.\n\nKen Rogoff focuses on internal vulnerabilities in China's economy. He notes that under Xi Jinping, the leadership has prioritized loyalty over technocratic competence, worsening governance. Rogoff attributes current economic stagnation to overinvestment and local government debt initiated during the 2010 stimulus. He draws parallels with Japan's lost decades, warning that China faces a similar path of long-term stagnation. He also comments on China's attempts to reduce dependence on the US dollar. On the US side, Rogoff warns of unsustainable debt levels and the potential for future inflation as a stealth form of default. He emphasizes the need for technocratic governance, especially in monetary policy, and sees AI as a transformative but politically destabilizing force.\n\nTogether, the podcasts show that China's economic rise is a product of both strategic state intervention and structural imbalances. While Kroeber sees the rise as a global integration challenge, Rogoff warns that China's internal weaknesses may prevent it from overtaking the US. Both stress the importance of strong institutions and caution against simplistic narratives of great power conflict."

        "question": "What did we talk about during the openpipe meeting?",
        "answer": "During the meeting with OpenPipe, you spoke with Kyle Corbitt (cofounder, engineering background) and Daniel Bolus (enterprise partnerships). The conversation focused on custom reinforcement learning (RL) solutions, particularly in enterprise contexts.\n\nYou asked about their RL experience, including sample efficiency—mentioning that you're data-constrained and referencing their ART-E blog post that used only 4k questions. You also asked about their product roadmap and discussed a potential use case on your end: Deep Research on client data. You explained your current situation, including a new on-prem cluster, difficulty with data availability, slow use case adoption, and limitations on training with production data.\n\nKyle shared insights into what types of use cases tend to stick and what doesn't work. Daniel asked what use cases you were currently thinking about. They explained that their ideal engagement is with companies that already have a concrete, important use case they've tried solving with off-the-shelf tools. Their engagements typically run 2-6 months and are high-touch, high-cost.\n\nThey've worked with customers like Vanguard to fine-tune a customer support chatbot and reduce hallucination rates, and with a data science consulting firm that had strict workflows involving SQL and a proprietary query language used to generate chart definitions.\n\nThey've had good success with using LLM-as-a-judge setups, although those can lead to reward hacking. Their process often involves letting training runs go for a day and then manually reviewing for any issues in how the reward model is being gamed.\n\nTraining runs typically last from a day to a week on a few H100s. These are usually done in a VPC, but they've also worked with individual on-prem clusters. They're open to doing short PoCs, often lasting 4-6 weeks.\n\nOverall, they emphasized that they're looking for important, well-defined business problems that generative AI has already been attempted on, ideally with internal stakeholders already invested."

        "question": "What was I reading on may 31st?",
        "answer": "On May 31st, you were reading and thinking about the following:\n\n1. 'Towards Universal Semantics with LLMs' (arXiv)\n\nYou explored challenges in translation, especially with capturing semantics and subtext.\n\nYou noted that language relies on shared cultural norms and idioms, and that dictionaries often have circular definitions.\n\nYou mentioned the Natural Semantic Metalanguage theory, which uses 'semantic primes' to try to represent all meanings.\n\n2. Mary Meeker's AI report (from Bond Capital)\n\nWhile you didn't summarize it directly, you included the link, suggesting you were skimming or starting to digest it.\n\n3. A quote from George Hitz (possibly George Hotz)\n\nYou reflected on a statement about copyright being 'doomed to fail' because it tries to create artificial scarcity in something (digital content) that is naturally abundant.\n\nYou were thinking about the implications for the U.S. versus countries like India and China, which may benefit from looser copyright enforcement.\n\nSo your reading and thinking on that day centered around semantics, copyright in the AI age, and broader implications of language and meaning in machine learning."
